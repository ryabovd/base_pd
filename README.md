This script works with the database in the file base_pd.csv (separated by semicolons).
The database data is stored and entered in the following order:
        'Surname First Name Middle Name (including REGISTER)', 
        'Date of birth dd.mm.yyyy', 
        'Place of Birth', 
        'Passport (Number, By whom issued, Date issued, Subdivision code)', 
        'SNILS (only digits)', 
        'TIN', 
        Address (Index, Region, City, Street, House, Apartment)', 
        'Telephone (+7********** several comma separated)', 
        'E-mail (several comma separated)', 
        'Date of relevance'
To start working with the database you need to create a file base_pd.csv in the directory with the script or make an entry through the script.
